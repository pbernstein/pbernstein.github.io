        <p>
        In the time that I've been at Transunion, it has grown from a private, Chicago based, US focused organization into a public company with a presence all over the world.  Currently I lead the enterprise Application Development Community of Practice and manage the Analytics Devops team.  I’ve worked on projects in a variety of offices, such as Chicago, Austin, South Africa, Colombia, and others. 
        <p>
        I go to a lot of meetings, help strong technical associates align their vision with one another, and I do hands on work in python, shell, typescript, and a platform we use called Ab Initio (imagine if SQL and C had a baby) to develop back end data processing (both batch and transnational) applications.
        </p>
        <p>
        I’ve also spoken at a conference or two, the last one being a conference in London on the topic of finding and growing talented application developers.
