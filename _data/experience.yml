        <p>
        In the time that I've been at Transunion, it has grown from a privately held, Chicago based, US focused organization into a public company with a presence all over the world.  Currently I lead the Enterprise Application Development Community of Practice and work with a variety of applications teams and platform automation teams.  I’ve worked on projects in a variety of offices, such as Chicago, Austin, South Africa, Colombia, and others. 
        <p>
        I do hands on work in Python, Shell, Typescript, a little bit of C, and a data processing platform we use called Ab Initio. I help strong technical associates align their vision with one another. I go to a lot of meetings.
        </p>
        <p>
        I’ve spoken at a conference or two, the last one being a conference in London on the topic of finding and growing talented application developers.
