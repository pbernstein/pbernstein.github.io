        Large and mini batch data processing with Python
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
        This is a Python project that scrapes a variety of pricing and fundamental data about the US stock market. It uses that data to publish matched and cleaned data.  There is also a component that uses that data predict what stocks are more likely to rise or fall, which is hooked into the Interacticve Brokers API to automate trading US stocks. It works, but running it with real money became too much baby sitting and I don't have enough capital to live off the return.

        Angular (Ionic) app with an AWS backend
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
        A ‘logistics’ front end/iphone application using Angular.  The app allows its users to keep track of inventory to be delivered to specific locations. Employees of our customers would use the app to track the inventory, get it signed for, track notes, status of the objects, etc. All sorts of cool stuff. The app uses a back end written in php with some AWS PAAS  (lambda, API Gateway, etc) services doing all the routing.
