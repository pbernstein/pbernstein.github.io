        After graduate school I built a python project that scrapes a variety of pricing and fundamental data about the US stock market. It uses that data to publish matched, cleaned data and automate trading US stocks. It works, but running it with real money became too much baby sitting and I don't have enough capital to live off the return. I haven’t maintained the project (other than formatting/cleaning it up for sharing) in years.

        To keep current in the front end development space I worked on a ‘logistics’ front end/iphone application using Angular.  The app allows its users to keep track of inventory to be delivered to specific locations. Employees of our customers would use the app to track the inventory, get it signed for, track notes, status of the objects, etc. All sorts of cool stuff. The app uses a back end written in php with some AWS PAAS  (lambda, API Gateway, etc) services doing all the routing.  Codebase available upon request

        I volunteer with a company called Lumity (https://lumity.org/ ) , which provides opportunities for professionals to give stem talks or help develop projects with high school students in Chicago’s inner city. During the talks that I’ve given and project working sessions I’ve attended, I’ve tried to help describe how those students can get involved in the application development community.
