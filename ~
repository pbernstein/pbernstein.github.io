  I am a Principal Architect at TransUnion, a global company that creates insight through information. 
  
  At TU I work with talented people all over the world. I lead a global team that writes large data processing systems, middle ware, web apps, and helps make TU an awesome place to be a developer.

  My public speaking experience ranges from mentoring groups of high school students to presenting for hundreds of attendees at development conferences. I am passionate about growing people and look for opportunities to share my experience.

          In the time that I've been at Transunion, it has grown from a privately held, Chicago based, US focused Credit Bureau into a global, public company with products in risk, healthcare, fraud, and a variety of other markets.

          I lead the Enterprise Application Development Community of Practice. My team and I work with a variety of application and platform automation teams across the enterprise in a variety of offices, including Chicago, Austin, South Africa, Colombia, and others.

          I do hands-on work in Python, Shell, Typescript, some C, and a data processing platform we use called Ab Initio. I've taught hundreds of associates in internal development training seminars. I help strong technical associates align their vision with one another. I go to a lot of meetings.

              This is a Python project that scrapes a variety of pricing and fundamental data about the US stock market. It uses that data to publish matched and cleaned data.  There is also a component that uses that data to predict what stocks are more likely to rise or fall that is hooked into the Interacticve Brokers API to automate trading US stocks.

              A ‘logistics’ front end/iphone application using Angular.  The app allows its users to keep track of inventory to be delivered to specific locations. Employees of our customers would use the app to track the inventory, sign it in, track notes, status of the objects, etc. The app uses a back end written in php with some AWS PAAS  (lambda, API Gateway, etc) services doing all the routing.  
              Code base available upon request.
